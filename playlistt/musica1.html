                                You've heard of people getting lost<br>
                                Here we don't even talk<br>
                                Don't drink my fear<br>
                                When I've had too much<br>
                                You've heard of people getting lost<br>
                                I wanna see you in the dark<br></p>

<p>And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new<br>

I say don't let me go<br>
And you say why can't we be friends<br>
All night I watch it burn<br>
And you say why can't we be friends<br>
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes<br>
I need a taxi<br></p>

<p>This world is pointless <br>
If you’re not here <br>
This world is pointless <br>
If we're not self-destructing love <br></p>

<p>it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new <br>
And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something<br></p>

<p>I say don't let me go<br>
And you say why can't we be friends<br>
All night I watch it burn<br>
And you say why can't we be friends<br>
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes<br>
I need a taxi<br></p>

<p>it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new<br>
And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something<br></p>

<p>I say don't let me go<br>
And you say why can't we be friends<br>
All night I watch it burn<br>
And you say why can't we be friends<br>
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes<br>
I need a taxi<br></p>
